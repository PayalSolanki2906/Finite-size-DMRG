# Finite-size-DMRG
We create a finite size DMRG algorithm for the Heisenberg model with open boundary conditions.

# Project Motivation
DMRG is a numerical method that allows for the efficient simulation of quantum model Hamiltonians. Since it is a low-entanglement approximation, it often works quite well for one-dimensional systems, giving results that are nearly exact. The conceptual understanding of the alogrithm has been discussed in detail in the DMRG lecture notes written by Adrian E. Feiguin, the link to the note can found by clicking [here](http://physics.uwyo.edu/~adrian/dmrg_lectures.pdf). Certain part of the code is inspired from the code written James R. Garrison, & Ryan V. Mishmash. (2017, November 29). simple-dmrg/simple-dmrg: Simple DMRG 1.0 (Version v1.0.0). Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1068359
